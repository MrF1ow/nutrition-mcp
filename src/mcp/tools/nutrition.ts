When the user gives a barcode — typed, or read from a photo of the package (transcribe the digits printed under the barcode) — call lookup_barcode first to get the product's label data, then scale it to the amount eaten. Fall back to web search or estimation only when no product is found. Use web search for branded products when no barcode is available. When logging from a photo of a plated or prepared meal (no package/barcode): first identify each dish, then establish whether it is a restaurant/takeout meal or homemade before anything else. If it is from a restaurant, ask which restaurant and where, then search the web for its menu — chains publish per-item nutrition worth using directly, independent places usually publish ingredient lists that reveal the butter, cream, and oil the photo hides; if you cannot find the menu or cannot tell which dish it is, say so and put your assumption to the user as a question rather than presenting a guess as menu data. Either way, estimate portions in household measures the user can eyeball (a glass of, a handful of, a tablespoon of — NOT grams; for restaurant servings ask how much of it they actually ate), call search_meals to see how similar meals were logged before and to surface ingredients that may be invisible in the photo, then interview the user across multiple turns — one question per message, covering which variation each dish is, how much they ate, and photo-invisible ingredients (oil, sugar, sauce, what a drink was made with) — until nothing is left open. Do NOT call this tool after a single question-and-answer round; a lone confirmation is not enough. Only call it once every open question is resolved and the user has approved a full summary of the meal (or has told you to stop asking and just log it). Write the confirmed household-measure portions into the description itself (e.g. 'Oatmeal (1 glass raw oats, 2 glasses milk) with banana') so future searches are self-describing, and for a restaurant meal name the venue and city too (e.g. 'Pad thai with chicken (1 plate, finished) at Thai Basil, Podil, Kyiv').\n\n" +

                "Import many past meals in one call, for backfilling history from a file the user exported from another app (MyFitnessPal, Cronometer, Lose It!, MacroFactor) or from a list they pasted. Parse the source yourself and map it to the row schema; the server validates every row and reports per-row results, so you can fix and re-send only the rows that failed. Prefer this over calling log_meal in a loop — log_meal is rate-limited per call, so a week of meals would exhaust the budget. Two rules matter for correctness. (1) Compute expected_row_count, and expected_total_kcal when every row has calories, FROM THE SOURCE FILE using deterministic tooling (a script, or counting the actual lines) — never by re-reading the JSON you just wrote, which would only compare your output against itself and catch nothing. (2) Call once with dry_run: true first whenever the rows came from parsing a CSV, a screenshot, or free text; check the resolved logged_at and meal_type echoed back for every row, show the user what will be imported, and only then call again with dry_run: false. Pass local times exactly as the file gives them and let the server apply the user's timezone; do not compute UTC offsets yourself, and do not guess a value you cannot find — omit the field and list the column in unmapped_columns instead. (3) Because those local times are placed using the user's saved timezone, check with get_timezone before a large import: if it is unset the server falls back to UTC, and correcting it afterwards moves every imported meal — including onto adjacent days for anything logged near midnight. Offer set_timezone first. Maximum " +

                MAX_ROWS_PER_CALL +
                " rows, that date has to be split across more than one call — the row cap is a hard server-side limit and wins over the same-call grouping. Doing so loosens deduplication for that date only: two rows in it that are byte-identical (same description, meal_type, calories, protein_g, carbs_g, fat_g, notes and logged_at) may collapse into one if they land in different calls, so prefer keeping duplicate-looking rows together in one call when you have to split. If the file is an export from THIS server (its header starts with an id column), map that column to source_id on every row, and map its timezone column to timezone on every row too — source_id is what makes restoring a backup a no-op instead of doubling the user's history, and timezone is what makes a restored row resolve at the local time it was actually recorded rather than the account's current timezone.",
