// rather than a stylistic one: caffeine's display gate is `!= null` everywhere
// (limitShown in shared/macros.js, recordedGoalLine and totalsPayloadOf here),
// so an explicit 0 on a sandwich is not a harmless extra data point — it puts a
// "0 mg / 400 mg limit" row on the dashboard of someone who has never had a
// coffee, and drags every caffeine average toward zero by joining the covered
// set (coveredDailyAverage in insights.ts). Fiber and sugar are typed as plain
// numbers in TOTALS_ITEM and already read as 0 when absent, so filling them in
// only ever adds fidelity.
//
// The reason omission is worse than an imperfect estimate: a NULL is not a
// zero, it excludes the entire DAY from that nutrient's averages and goal lines
// (dayCarries in insights.ts), so one forgotten fiber figure silently deletes a
// day from the user's fiber trend rather than making it slightly wrong.

- fiber_g and sugar_g: send them on EVERY meal, exactly as you already send protein, carbs and fat. Not knowing the exact figure is not a reason to leave one out — you do not know the exact protein either. Work in this order: a nutrition label, a barcode lookup, or a chain's published per-item nutrition; then a web search for that product or dish; then your own estimate from the ingredients and the portion. A 0 is the right answer wherever 0 is true (a steak, eggs, oil, black coffee) — what is wrong is omitting the field, because a missing value is not a zero: it records "nobody measured this" and drops the whole day out of the user's fiber and sugar averages, goal lines and charts.
- caffeine_mg: decide it deliberately on every entry instead of defaulting to silence, but only send a number when the item really is a caffeine source — coffee of any kind (decaf included, about 2-5 mg), tea, matcha, yerba mate, cola and many other soft drinks, energy drinks, pre-workout, chocolate and cocoa, coffee ice cream, caffeine tablets. If it is one, get the figure from the label or the chain's nutrition, or search the web for the branded drink, or fall back to the typical amounts in the field description. If the item is plainly not a caffeine source, OMIT the field rather than sending 0 — an explicit 0 means "measured, and it was none", which turns on a caffeine row for a user who never consumes any.`;

// bulk_import_meals, where a schema-level rejection fires BEFORE the handler and
// throws away the structured per-row report, the warnings and the analytics row
// — for what is that tool's single most common caller mistake. log_meal,
// update_meal and set_nutrition_goals have no such report to lose: their whole
// output is the one row they just wrote. There, rejecting in the schema is
// strictly better, because the alternative is a raw Postgres `check (fiber_g >=
// 0)` violation surfaced verbatim to the model.
//
// The upper bound is not cosmetic. zod 4's z.number() rejects Infinity but
// accepts 1e308 — and Math.round(1e308 * 10) / 10 IS Infinity, so a single
// absurd meal made every later get_nutrition_summary / get_goal_progress /
// log_meal for that date fail the SDK's outputSchema validation (those schemas
// are z.number(), which refuses Infinity) until the row was deleted by hand.

// `alcohol` is the whole alcohol opt-in, threaded once: the drink unit to render
// grams in, or null when this user has alcohol tracking off. It is resolved from
// the profile in buildMcpServer (like widgetsEnabled) rather than re-read inside
// every handler, because a per-request server means one read serves the whole
// request and every formatter can take it as a plain argument.
//
// At the write layer it gates DISPLAY only. Alcohol passed to log_meal /
// update_meal / bulk_import_meals is always stored — dropping a value the caller
// explicitly sent would be silent data loss, and the flag exists to keep trace
// alcohol from imported recipes out of sight, not out of the database.
//
// The one place a null `alcohol` changes what gets WRITTEN is the import widget,
// which then declines to map the file's alcohol column at all rather than write
// a number it was forbidden to show the user for review. That is the widget's
// choice, announced to the user on screen, not a rule this server enforces — see
// startImportPayload for the full trade-off.
// Exported for tests: the only way to exercise a tool handler end-to-end
// (schema coercion, handler, response text) is to register the tools on a real
// McpServer and call them through a client. Production still reaches this only
