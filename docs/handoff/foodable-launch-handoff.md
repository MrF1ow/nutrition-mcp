# Foodable launch handoff

Written 2026-10-05. For an agent with access to GitHub, Supabase, and Railway. It takes Foodable from "merged" to "live for the household", starting with an empty database.

Read `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/handoff/foodable-architecture-plan.md` (its "Status at handoff" section) first. This file does not repeat them.

## Status (2026-10-05)

**Done**

- Preflight was green at `ee7f06f`: `bun test`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run format:check`, `bun run gen:all`, and `bun run db:dryrun` all passed.
- A new empty Supabase project exists: ref `dapbxswqfiqvxutsobhr`, region `us-east-1`, name **Foodable**. All 39 migrations are applied there. `public` has 31 tables. The `exports` storage bucket exists. Email and password sign-in is enabled; confirmation email is off (mailer autoconfirm). No data was copied from the old project. The old Supabase project and the old server were not touched.
- Local server checks on an agent machine against that project passed: `GET /health` returned `ok`, `GET /` served the Foodable sign-in page, and OAuth discovery URLs used host `127.0.0.1` with `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` unset. The server was then stopped (port 8080); it is **not** still running.

**Not done**

- The two-person household sign-in (step 4) has not been done.
- The end-to-end walk (step 5) has not been done.
- Railway was not created. DNS was not changed. Phase 8 has not started.
- The fridge ledger gap and the old-name leftovers are still open on `main`. Separate pull requests for them were opened at the same time as the doc update that recorded this status; they are **not** on `main` yet.

**Unchanged gates:** repo name `MrF1ow/nutrition-mcp`, sky accent, version `0.1.0`.

**Deploy day is still ahead.** Remaining work, in order:

1. Create the Railway service.
2. Set its variables.
3. Set `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` from the generated domain.
4. Connect the AI clients.
5. Retire the old Supabase project and the old server (with explicit user confirmation).

## Decisions already made

- **Start fresh.** Delete every user's data. Nothing is migrated, exported, or restored from the current deploy. A new Supabase project replaces the old one.
- **Host on Railway** for now, from the repo's `Dockerfile`. Supabase cloud stays the database, Auth, and storage.
- **Unchanged gates.** The repo stays `MrF1ow/nutrition-mcp`. The sky accent stays until a logo exists. The version stays `0.1.0`. Phase 8 waits until this deploy has run for a while.

## Where the code is

- Phases 0 to 7 are merged. `bun test` passes 1057 tests (after `bun run gen:all`). `bun run typecheck` and `bun run format:check` are clean. CI is green.
- `tools/list` returns 69 tools.
- There are 39 migrations. They were applied in order to an empty Postgres (with Supabase stubs) on 2026-10-05. All 39 applied, and the result has 31 tables in `public`.
- The app is Railway-ready as is:
    - It binds `0.0.0.0` on `PORT`, which Railway injects.
    - `/health` returns `ok`.
    - It writes nothing to local disk. Exports go to Supabase storage.
    - The site cookie gets `Secure` once `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` is `https://…`.

## Access you need

Get these from the user before starting. Do not paste secrets into PRs, commits, or chat logs.

- [ ] GitHub push access to `MrF1ow/nutrition-mcp`.
- [ ] A Supabase account that can create a project, and a CLI login (`bunx supabase login`).
- [ ] A Railway account with the GitHub repo connected. Hobby is $5/month including $5 of usage, which a single small Bun service should fit.
- [ ] The **old** Supabase project ref, and where the **old** server runs, so both can be retired in step 6.
- [ ] A contact email for `OFF_USER_AGENT`. Open Food Facts requires one.
- [ ] Two household people to sign in for the walk in step 5: the owner and one member. Prefer that the user drives the browser for sign-ins, so passwords stay with them.

## Rules for this run

- Stop and report on any failure. Do not improvise past a failed step.
- Ask the user once, explicitly, before anything irreversible: deleting the old Supabase project, or shutting down the old server. "Start fresh" is the decision. The moment is still theirs to confirm.
- Never edit a migration once it is applied to the new project. Fixes go in a new migration.
- Repo changes go through a PR with green CI. Do not push to `main`.
- Report evidence: command output, URLs, screenshots of the walk.

---

## 1. Preflight

- [x] `git clone`, `bun install`, `bun run gen:all`. (Green at `ee7f06f` on 2026-10-05.)
- [x] `bun test`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run format:check` all pass.
- [x] `bun run db:dryrun` passes. Set `PG_BIN` if `initdb` is not on `PATH`. This exercises the migration chain and the Phase 2 backfill on a fixture.

## 2. New Supabase project

Why a new project and not `supabase db reset --linked`: a remote reset only rebuilds the `public` schema. Auth users survive, and storage files are orphaned. Foodable's first-user flow signs up a new account only while Auth is empty (`docs/self-hosting.md`, "First-user flow"). Leftover Auth users would turn the first visit into a sign-in with no household. A new project gives an empty Auth, empty storage, and empty migration history in one step.

- [x] Create the project in the Supabase dashboard. Pick the region closest to the Railway service's region. (2026-10-05: ref `dapbxswqfiqvxutsobhr`, `us-east-1`, name Foodable.)
- [x] Authentication: email and password enabled. **Confirm email off**, so the owner can sign in immediately.
- [x] Note the project URL (`SUPABASE_URL`) and the **service role** secret (`SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`). The anon or publishable key is not enough. (Recorded outside this doc; do not commit secrets.)
- [x] Apply the schema:

    ```bash
    bunx supabase link --project-ref dapbxswqfiqvxutsobhr
    bunx supabase db push --dry-run   # must list all 39 migrations
    bunx supabase db push
    bunx supabase migration list      # local and remote columns match, 39 rows
    ```

- [x] Verify the result in the SQL editor:
    - `select count(*) from pg_tables where schemaname = 'public'` returns 31.
    - `select id from storage.buckets` includes `exports`.
- [ ] Know the free-plan catch. Supabase pauses a free project after a week without database activity. Daily household use keeps it awake. If it is ever paused, restore it from the dashboard. A paid Supabase plan never pauses.

### Local smoke (2026-10-05, not production)

Against the new project, with env vars set locally and `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` unset:

- [x] `GET /health` returned `ok`.
- [x] `GET /` served the Foodable sign-in page.
- [x] OAuth discovery URLs used host `127.0.0.1`.
- [x] Server stopped afterward; port 8080 is not in use.

## 3. Railway

- [ ] Add `railway.toml` at the repo root in a small PR, so the deploy config lives with the code:

    ```toml
    [build]
    builder = "DOCKERFILE"
    dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile"

    [deploy]
    healthcheckPath = "/health"
    healthcheckTimeout = 60
    restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
    ```

    Railway detects the root `Dockerfile` without this, but the healthcheck keeps a broken boot from taking traffic. Merge it before creating the service, or redeploy after.

- [ ] Create a Railway project, then a service from the GitHub repo on `main`.
- [ ] Set the service variables. Generate fresh OAuth credentials with `bun run generate-oauth-creds`. Do not reuse the old deploy's values.

    | Variable              | Value                                                     |
    | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `SUPABASE_URL`        | new project URL                                           |
    | `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` | new project service role secret                           |
    | `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`     | fresh, from `generate-oauth-creds`                        |
    | `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | fresh, from `generate-oauth-creds`; also signs the cookie |
    | `OFF_USER_AGENT`      | `Foodable (<contact email>)`                              |
    | `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`       | `https://<railway domain>`, set after the next step       |

    Do **not** set `PORT`. Railway injects it, and the app reads it. `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is not needed.

- [ ] Networking: **Generate Domain**. Set `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` to that `https://` origin with no trailing slash, then redeploy. Without it, OAuth metadata follows forwarded headers. With it, the advertised URLs and the Secure cookie are pinned. If the user adds a custom domain later, add Railway's CNAME and TXT records, then change `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` to the custom origin.
- [ ] Checks after deploy:
    - `curl https://<domain>/health` returns `ok`.
    - `GET /` serves the login page.
    - `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` advertises URLs on `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`.
    - The deploy logs show no Supabase errors.

## 4. First user, household, second member

Follow `docs/self-hosting.md`, "First-user flow".

- [ ] The owner opens `/`, signs up with email and password, then submits **Create household**.
- [ ] A second sign-up email at `/` is refused (`signup_closed`).
- [ ] The owner adds the second person in **Settings → Household** (`/settings/household`). That person signs in.
- [ ] Connect each person's AI client to `https://<domain>/mcp` and complete OAuth. Remove any old Foodable or nutrition-mcp connection from those clients, because it points at the old deploy.

## 5. The walk

This is Cursor's end-to-end walk, run on the live site with two members. Capture a screenshot or tool output for each line.

- [ ] **Foods.** On `/settings/foods`, save **Eggs** with grams per each and calories per 100 g. Save **Toast** the same way.
- [ ] **Food-backed meal.**
    - On `/`, set Meal type to Breakfast.
    - Add Eggs: amount 2, unit each. Use **Add another food** for Toast: amount 1, unit each. Submit **Log meal**.
    - Expect the meal total to equal the sum of the item snapshots.
- [ ] **Snapshot.** Change the egg calories on `/settings/foods`. Expect the logged breakfast to keep the old total.
- [ ] **Recipe to grocery.**
    - On `/recipes`, save a recipe that uses eggs. Put a note on an ingredient and a tag on the recipe.
    - Submit **Add to grocery**. Expect only what is not already stocked to be added.
- [ ] **Put away.** On `/grocery`, check that line and submit **Put away**. Expect `/fridge` to show the new stock. (**Clear checked** deliberately does not stock the fridge.)
- [ ] **Cook.** On the recipe, submit **Cooked it** with **Log meals** checked, for both members. Expect:
    - The fridge count drops, and two meals appear, one per member.
    - If stock is short, the shortfall is reported and the fridge does not go negative.
    - With two lots of the same food, the earlier expiry is used first.
- [ ] **Eat and toss.** On `/fridge`, submit **Ate it** on one item and **Toss** on another. Expect **Ate it** to also log a meal.
- [ ] **Export.** Run `export_all_data`. Expect:
    - The ZIP holds `meals.csv`, `meal_items.csv`, `water.csv`, `weight.csv`, `goals.csv`, `profile.csv` and `README.txt`.
    - `meal_items.csv` is keyed by `meal_id`, has a `timezone` column, and keeps its header with zero rows.
- [ ] **Agent surface.**
    - `tools/list` returns 69 tools.
    - `get_meals`, `get_water`, `get_weight`, `get_fridge`, `get_household_rules` and `set_household_rules` exist. The old split names are gone.
    - `list_grocery_lines` and `get_fridge` render their cards in a widget-capable client.
- [ ] **Barcode.** `lookup_barcode` on a real product returns data, which proves `OFF_USER_AGENT` is set.

Known gap, not a walk failure: manual fridge add, edit and delete do not write `stock_movements` rows (see the plan's open items). Do not "fix" it during the launch.

## 6. Retire the old deploy

The decision is to delete all old user data. Confirm with the user once, right before each step below.

- [ ] Shut down the old server, wherever the user says it runs.
- [ ] Delete the old Supabase project from its project settings in the dashboard. Deleting the project removes its Auth users, data, and storage together. No export or dump of it is wanted.
- [ ] Revoke anything that still points at the old deploy: OAuth connections in AI clients, and any DNS record for the old host.

## 7. Repo follow-up (after launch)

- [x] `docs/handoff/foodable-architecture-plan.md`: "Status at handoff" updated on 2026-10-05 with preflight, the new Supabase project ref, local smoke, and what remains before deploy day. Walk result stays unchecked until step 5 runs.
- [ ] `docs/self-hosting.md`: add a short Railway section, with the `railway.toml` above, the variables, "do not set `PORT`", and `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` from the generated domain. (After Railway exists.)
- [ ] Update the memory or notes the user keeps on hosting: Railway, chosen 2026-10-05, "for now". (After Railway exists.)

## 8. After launch, in order

1. **Ledger gap.** Make manual fridge add, edit and delete go through `applyMovement` with reason `adjust`, so `ledgerMatchesStock` holds for every item. Do this before anything reads the ledger as history.
2. **Old-name leftovers.** The export object path `nutrition-mcp-export.zip`, `bun.lock`'s package name, and test fixtures. The fresh start means no old export files are left to strand, so renaming the path is free now.
3. **Phase 8 (contract)** once the deploy has run stably, after a fresh backup. With a fresh start there is no legacy `identity` data to worry about, only rows written since launch.
4. **Gated items** when the user decides: the repo rename, the logo and brand accent, and the optional weekly household digest.

## Notes on `db:dryrun` from here

Fixture mode (`bun run db:dryrun`) stays useful as is. It applies everything before `DEFAULT_PENDING_FROM`, seeds the fixture, then applies every later migration, including any added after launch, and checks the backfill. Leave `DEFAULT_PENDING_FROM` alone. For a dry run on real data before a future push, dump the new project with `pg_dump --data-only --schema=public`. Then pass `--pending-from <first unapplied version>` along with `--data`.
